							Foundation, dedicated to steaching Local Youth the cultural Arts,

						<p>Our mission is to provide all Youth with a NEW Positive Life
							Style through education and real world, profitable experiences.
							The IAM Youth Program provides organization, inspiration,

							"LOVE" THE PRINCIPLE TO PEACE:<br> Gang members "LOVE" their
							family members and fellow gang members. Most people think that it
							is the power of hatred that is causing our children to kill each
							other. I beg to dffer with this ans offer that it is the
							"Mis-Guided Power of LOVE". Most of our youth do not know the
							rival gang members they are shooting at well enough to have
							developed "HATE" for the person, only hate for the rival gang
							they represent.It is the "LOVE" the youth has forhis/her fellow
							"gang member" or "family member" that fuels the emotion of
							revenge and makes the gang member want to take violent action. It
							is the "LOVE" of the brotherhood/Sisterhood that fuels the
							"HATRED"! We must use that same emotion of "LOVE" to bring about
							PEACE!

							<br> <br>
						
						<p>
							"UNITY"- PRINCIPLE TO SUCCESS:<br> If you want to stop a Bad
							Gang, one way is to build a Bigger and Better Gang. The Bigger &
							Better Gang must provide a new standard of:<br>"COMMUNITY UNITY &
							POSITIVE YOUTH SERVICE"!
						</p> <img src="images/small-brd.jpg" alt="" height="3" width="500">

						<br> <br> <br>

						<p>
							MATCHING INCINTIVE:<br> We must provide our youth with at least
							the same service the gangs offr them:<br> 1. Some money in their
							pockets<br> 2. A special FAMILY to beling to.
						</p> <img src="images/small-brd.jpg" alt="" height="3" width="500">
						<br> <br> <br>
						<p>
							MEDIATION PRINCIPLE #1: "A PIECE OF THE ACTION": <br> The history
							of American Gang Warfare show us that the best way to come to an
							agreement and bring about PEACE is for one gang to give up some
							territoryand money making opportunity to the opposing gang.
							Ouryouth does not have any real ownership in our communities.
							This has to change. Once our youth gain opportunities for
							community ownership and development there will be PEACE.
						</p> <img src="images/small-brd.jpg" alt="" height="3" width="500">
						<br> <br> <br>

						<p>
							MEDIATION PRINCIPLE #2:<br> "LOVE FOR THEIR YOUNGER FAMILY
							MEMBER"<br> <br> Unless the Gang Member has totally lost his/her
							mind, any real gang member with real street experience DOES NOT
							want their younger family member to have to live that gang/street
							lifestyle. This love for their younger family member opens the
							door for cooperation between us and the hard core gang member.
							But it means nothing unless we provide the opportunitiy for a
							positive and progressive TOTALLY NEW YOUTH LIFESTYLE!

							"CREATING THE I-AM FAMILY"<br> <br> We must recruit 1000 Local
							Community People, Businesses, Churches or Organizations that will
							donate $20.00 per month for one year. We call out sponsors "I-AM
							ANGELS"! This will give us a monthly budget of $20,000 per month,
							for one year. Your $20.00 donation will be distributed as
							follows:<br> <br> $10.00 Per Month goes directly to the pocket of
							the I-AM Youth Member. Our Goal is to identify 100 Local Youth
							who have Entreprenurial Talentthat we can help develop. When our
							I-AM Youth Member has 10 I-AM Angels (Sponsors) who provide
							him/her with $10.00 per month, that youth now has an account
							budget worth $100.00 per month for on year. Collectively the 100
							I-AM's have a monthly budget of $10,000 Per Month.

							I-AM Angels we will gather the 500 people together, wearing our
							shirts & hats, to produce a public service TV & Radio
							announcement stating the following:<br>
							<br> "are you between the ages of 8 and 18? Do you have talent
							for business?"<br>
							<br> Would you like to earn a minimum of $100.00 per month for
							the next 12 months?<br>
